# ShoutFramework
<p>The Shout Framework is a framework mod with a number of features centered around modifying Mission Control in an easy and organized manner. Modifying dwarf voicelines is still under development. It is named "Shout Framework" in reference to the "shout" files that dictate what the dwarves and Mission Control say.</p>
