# ShoutFramework
<p>The Shout Framework is a framework mod with a number of features centered around modifying Mission Control and Dwarf voice lines in an easy and organized manner. It is named "Shout Framework" in reference to the "shout" files that dictate what the Dwarves and Mission Control say.</p>
